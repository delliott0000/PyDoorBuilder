# Introduction
This file documents shared behaviour and workflows that are used in the WebSocket subprotocol.

It is recommended to read through [HTTP](../HTTP) in its entirety first; this subfolder will reference some things that are defined there.

# Scope & Purpose
The subprotocol only defines application-level messages and behaviours. Transport semantics, such as connection liveliness and message size limits, are handled solely at the WebSocket level and are not documented here.

Before we get into the details, a reminder of the purpose of this subprotocol:
- Send & receive `States` for syncing and store them for later recovery.
- Defer resource-intensive tasks, such as file generation, to an `Autopilot`.

# Message Flow
Each message must be an `Event` or an `Ack`. An `Event` contains information. An `Ack` simply acknowledges an `Event`.

The following rules define the `Event`/`Ack` message flow:
- Each `Event` must be assigned a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID).
- Each `Event` must be acknowledged exactly once, within the time limit supplied by the server during the [handshake phase](#connection-phases).
- Each `Ack` must reference an `Event` by specifying the UUID of that `Event`.
- Each `Ack` must reference an `Event` that exists and has not already been acknowledged.
- `Events` and `Acks` may be sent & received out of order.

Please note that while UUIDs should ideally be unique within the scope of the WebSocket connection, this is not strictly required in practice. An implementation may discard an outgoing `Event` and its UUID as soon as it has been acknowledged - this is actually recommended to reduce the memory usage of a long-lasting or high-throughput connection. Therefore, a sending peer is only required to ensure UUID uniqueness within its current set of unacknowledged outgoing `Events`.  Peers may generate UUIDs using any method they choose.

# Message Structure
Each message must be a text frame that can be parsed into a valid JSON object.

Below is a list of top-level fields and their corresponding types and enumerations for each message type.

Each field is mandatory unless `None` is listed as an allowed type, in which case that field is optional. Omitting an optional field should be interpreted in the same way as an explicit `None` for that field.

`Event` fields:
```py
{
    "type": "event",  # By definition; Enum ["event"]
    "id": str,  # UUID
    "sent_at": str,  # ISO 8601
    "status": str,  # Enum ["ok", "error", "fatal"]
    "reason": str | None,  # For logging and traceback
    "payload": dict[str, Any]  # Actual data
}
```

`Ack` fields:
```py
{
    "type": "ack",  # By definition; Enum ["ack"]
    "id": str,  # UUID of an Event
    "sent_at": str  # ISO 8601
}
```

The `"status"` field describes the outcome of an `Event`. Unless the value is `"fatal"`, this field does not mandate any specific behaviour from the receiving peer.
- `"ok"` indicates that an `Event` occurred without error.
- `"error"` indicates that a recoverable application-level error occurred. The connection may remain open.
- `"fatal"` indicates that an unrecoverable application-level error occurred. The connection must immediately close.

The `"reason"` field is an optional, human-readable string for logging, debugging and so on. This field does not mandate any specific behaviour from the receiving peer.

The `"payload"` field contains the actual data associated with an `Event`. Its semantics are defined in [Connection Phases](#connection-phases) and [Contents](Contents).

The following rules apply to top-level and payload-level fields.

It *is* a violation of the subprotocol to:
- Miss a mandatory field.
- Supply a value of an incorrect type.
- Supply a value that is not a member of the field's designated enumeration or is otherwise structurally invalid. (For instance, ISO 8601 strings.)
- Send an `Event` with `"status": "fatal"`.

It *is not* a violation of the subprotocol to:
- Supply an undocumented field. The receiving peer can safely ignore this.

# Connection Phases
Each connection is divided into two application-level phases; the handshake phase and the messaging phase.

...

# Close Codes
If and only if a peer violates the subprotocol, then the other peer must immediately close the WebSocket connection with the appropriate custom WebSocket close code.

Close codes and their corresponding failure scenarios:
- **4001** - A message is not a text frame.
- **4002** - A message cannot be parsed into a valid JSON object.
- **4003** - A message is missing a mandatory field.
- **4004** - A message supplies a value of an incorrect type.
- **4005** - A message supplies a value that is not a member of the field's designated enumeration or is otherwise structurally invalid.

Not part of the subprotocol per se, but still application-specific:
- **4000** - Sent by the server when the `Token` that was used to open the WebSocket connection is no longer valid.
