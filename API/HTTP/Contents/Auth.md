## Group-Level Rules
No group-level rules apply to this group.

## POST /auth/login
Exchange a username and a password for a `Token`. If a valid `session_id` is supplied, then the API will retrieve that `Session`. Otherwise, it will open a new `Session`.

Supplied by the client application:
```py
{
    "username": str,
    "password": str
    "session_id": str  # Optional
}
```

Returned by the API:
```py
{
    "token": Token
}
```

- If the username/password is missing or of the wrong type, the API will return `400 Bad Request`.
- If the username/password is incorrect, the API will return `401 Unauthorized`.

## POST /auth/refresh
Renew a `Token` by supplying the refresh key, extending the duration that it is valid for.

Supplied by the client application:
```py
{
    "refresh": str
}
```

Returned by the API:
```py
{
    "token": Token
}
```

- If the refresh key is missing or of the wrong type, the API will return `400 Bad Request`.
- If the refresh key is incorrect, the API will return `401 Unauthorized`.

## POST /auth/logout
Invalidate a `Token`, preventing it from being used for any subsequent requests, including renewals.

Returned by the API:
```py
{
    "token": Token
}
```
